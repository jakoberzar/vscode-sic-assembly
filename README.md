# SIC Assembly

This extension adds the support for the [SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Instructional_Computer) assembly.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Snippets
- Code formatting
- Setting the default language indentation to 8 character long tabs

### Code formatting
The Format Document action automatically aligns the columns in your SIC code, so there's enough space for labels, mnemonics and operands.
